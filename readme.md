## ℹ️ General informations
Bonus not included. Subject attached. </br>
Basic implementation of printf. Straightforward code and as clean as possible.</br>

## 🎉 Testing

Tested by moulinette (100%) and [francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette).
As in many 42 implementations, for this project, the write function is not protected. So there are errors in `francinette --strict` mode. The moulinette does not check this particular case.</br>
