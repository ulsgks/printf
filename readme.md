## 🖨️ General information
Bonus not included. Subject attached. </br>
Basic implementation of printf. Straightforward code and as clean as possible.</br>

## 🚀 Export version
This repo is an exportable version of my printf project.
The original project is stored in the .tar archive.

Change log:
- Makefile create obj/ directory
- header in a new include/ directory
</br>

## 🚧 Testing
Tested by moulinette (100%) and [francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette).
As in many 42 implementations, for this project, the write function is not protected. So there are errors in `francinette --strict` mode. The moulinette doesn't check this particular case.
